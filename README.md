This is a simple Contact Management System implemented using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The system allows users to manage a list of contacts, including adding new contacts, viewing the list, editing existing contacts, and deleting contacts.

## Features

- **Add Contact:** Users can input details such as name, email, and phone number through a form.
- **Validation:** Input fields are validated using Regular Expressions to ensure data integrity.
- **View Contacts:** All contacts are displayed with options to edit and delete.
- **Edit Contact:** Users can update the details of an existing contact.
- **Delete Contact:** Users can remove a contact from the list after confirmation.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the provided form to add new contacts by filling in the name, email, and phone number.
3. View the list of contacts displayed below the form.
4. Click the "Edit" button to modify the details of an existing contact.
5. Click the "Delete" button to remove a contact from the list.

## Input Validation

- The system validates that all fields (name, email, and phone) are filled in before adding a new contact.
- Email is checked for a basic format, ensuring it contains the '@' symbol.
- Phone number is checked for a minimum length of digits.

## Error Handling

- Error messages are displayed in case of invalid input or unsuccessful operations.
- The error message disappears after a few seconds.

## Additional Notes

- The code structure is split into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for better organization.
- Regular Expressions can be customized for more robust input validation.
- Email and phone validation are simplified; you may enhance them based on specific requirements.
